## Climate Disaster Economic Impact Prediction

### Overview
Built a regression-based machine learning pipeline to predict economic losses (USD millions) from global climate disasters using real-world data.

### Tools & Technologies
Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib

### Key Work
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis and OLS regression with p-value filtering
- Model comparison using RMSE, MSE, and MAE

### Results
Selected Linear Regression as the final model due to strong performance and interpretability for policy and risk-planning use.
