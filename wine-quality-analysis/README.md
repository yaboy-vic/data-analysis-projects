## Wine Quality Analysis (Red vs White)

### Overview
Analyzed red and white wine datasets to understand which chemical properties influence wine quality, and built predictive models to classify high-quality wines and estimate quality scores.

### Datasets
- winequality-red.csv
- winequality-white.csv

### Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and merging datasets
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlation analysis
- Feature scaling and model comparison
- Classification (good vs not-good quality) and/or regression (predict quality)

### Business Value
Helps identify the most influential quality drivers, supporting production decisions and quality control.
